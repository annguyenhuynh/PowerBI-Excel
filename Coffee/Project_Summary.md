* This project aims at analyzing coffee sales across three countries that this coffee brand is being sold. Specifically, this project looks at which type of coffee is the best seller in a particular country, which days and months witness the highest sales, the changing rate of loyal customers, etc. 
* The main functions used in this project included XLOOKUP, INDEXMATCH, PIVOT TABLE, and PIVOT CHART. These charts are put together to create a summarized KPI dashboards. 
* One important lesson learned in this project was when to use Lookups and when to use Index Match. XLookup used to populate row_based values from one table to another table, and VLookup is used to paste information of one column in a table to another table. Index Match is the combination of XLookup and VLookup. Using Index Match allows one to populate values horizontally and vertically simultaneously. 
* A dynamic KPI dasboard can be created in Excel by adding slicers to pivot chart. To ensure slicers applied to all charts, copy the chart used to create the slicers in the first place, and make modifications.
